# Anti-Fraud Community Group Proposals

This repository is where [Anti-Fraud CG](https://antifraudcg.github.io/) proposals are discussed before being turned into their own repositories.

## Proposal Workflow

1. **Join the Community Group.** Before contributing a proposal, please [join the CG](https://www.w3.org/community/antifraud/join). This is to ensure that all contributions to the Community Group are covered by the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).

2. **Proposing.** [File a new issue](https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues/new) in which you state the problem and proposal. Please check whether there are [current](https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues/) or [shelved proposals](SHELVED.MD) that match your proposal.

3. **Community Discussion.** The CG will discuss the proposal and determine whether it should be adopted or needs further refinement and specification.

5. **Refinement.** Once the proposal has been discussed and adopted, we'll spin it off as a separate work item in its own repository for continued development and refinement.

6. **Standards Track.** Once the proposal is ready for standardization, it will be migrated form the Community Group to an appropriate standards body (WHATWG, WebAppSec, etc).

## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, all work and communication within the Anti-Fraud CG
is covered by the
[W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
